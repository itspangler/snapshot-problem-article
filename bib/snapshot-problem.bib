  abstract = {This paper addresses the discourse for a proactive thinking of futurity, intimately concerned with technology, which comes to an influential fruition in the discussion and representation of `ubiquitous computing'. The imagination, proposal, or playing out of ubiquitous computing environments are bound up with particular ways of constructing futurity. This paper charts the techniques used in ubiquitous computing development to negotiate that futurity. In so doing, it engages with recent geographical debates around anticipation and futurity. The discussion accordingly proceeds in four parts. First, the spatial imagination engendered by the development of ubiquitous computing is explored. Second, particular techniques in ubiquitous computing research and development for anticipating future technology use, and their limits, are discussed through empirical findings. Third, anticipatory knowledge is explored as the basis for stable means of future orientation, which both generates and derives from the techniques for anticipating futures. Fourth, the importance of studying future orientation is situated in relation to the somewhat contradictory nature of anticipatory knowledges of ubicomp and related forms of spatial imagination.},

Map librarians are questioning current practices, juggling priorities, shifting focus, and changing procedures as electronic cartographic materials become a larger part of their map collections. Cataloging practices are no exception to this transformation. This paper presents a preliminary examination of current cataloging rules, guidelines, and practices for electronic cartographic material, focusing on access points.},

  abstract = {The North Carolina Geospatial Data Archiving Project (NCGDAP) is a partnership of the North Carolina (NC) State University Libraries and the NC Center for Geographic Information \& Analysis focused on preservation of state and local geospatial data. This project, executed under an agreement with the Library of Congress as part of the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIIPP), is helping to inform development of a national digital preservation infrastructure through a learning-by-doing approach focused on identifying, acquiring, and preserving content within the context of the NC OneMap initiative and its framework of partnerships with state, local, and federal agencies. Although the collection-building aspect of this project is focused solely on the state of North Carolina, the project has served as a demonstration that informs data archiving and time series development more generally. The article discusses how the project has responded to key challenges, including identifying data resources for the archive, data acquisition, determining frequency of data capture, engaging the data producer community and industry, processing and creation of metadata, and repository development. The article also highlights newer initiatives that have emerged as outcomes of the project.},

  abstract = {The role of academic libraries in providing access to and preserving geographic information has seen considerable change. Some libraries are beginning to provide access to geospatial data using geospatial data catalogs and geospatial Web services. Academic libraries are interested in developing geospatial data catalogs, but this can be complicated. The technology is rapidly evolving and many have questions around what software to use and what staffing might be required. The American Library Association (ALA) Map and Geospatial Information Round Table (MAGIRT) Geographic Technologies Committee established the Spatial Data Subcommittee in September 2010 to investigate spatial data catalogs and provide recommendations to MAGIRT on technology, staffing needs, and similar issues needed to develop a spatial data catalog. The subcommittee conducted interviews with eleven geospatial data catalog managers at academic libraries that yielded findings showing the diversity of implementation and prioritization. Guidance is provided that will help academic libraries determine what the best approach is for their situation and needs on their campus.},

  abstract = {Due to the exponential growth of spatial information, effective management and curation of geospatial data has become a central concern for GIS libraries. Although geospatial data are often generated based on a set of well-established standards and protocols, best management practices in geospatial data services are still limited. In this paper, the authors review the common challenges of geospatial data management and curation, which include the application of big data, the emergence of Web GIS, and the advancement of cyberinfrastructures. A spatial education project is used as an example to discuss potential best management practices to address these challenges. It is demonstrated that librarians need to be involved at the early stage of a research project and work closely with researchers at all stages of the data life cycle for effective data management. With early involvement of a GIS librarian in the full project development process, all three challenges can be addressed by using best management practices in organizing, managing, publishing, distributing, and preserving the geospatial data.},

  abstract = {The University of Florida GeoPlan Center has been organizing, standardizing, and distributing geospatial data since 1998 through the Florida Geographic Data Library (FGDL), a collection of Florida geospatial data from various agencies, as well as data developed in-house. With funding from the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT), FGDL serves as a public distribution mechanism for hundreds of Florida geospatial data layers. Since 2004, FGDL layers have formed the data foundation for FDOT's interagency application known as efficient transportation decision making (ETDM), which facilitates the review and permitting process for proposed transportation projects. Data layers are standardized and inspected to ensure that the data are adequate for use in analysis and decision making. To efficiently manage the geospatial data and workflows, a quality assurance/quality control (QAQC) process and relational database schema was developed to track the standardization procedures, lineage, versioning, and archiving of the data layers. This article details the history of the Florida Geographic Data Library, challenges of managing a large geospatial data repository, development of a QAQC process and database schema, and lessons learned.},

GIS uses maps as output mediums for displaying demographic or similar information, as well as for spatial comparison or spatially based analysis. This is useful for gaining knowledge as well as for decision making. This article reports research into the awareness and use of GIS-type systems in public library settings in hopes of better understanding the benefits, drawbacks, and limitations to use of systems such as these. Primary findings suggest that there continues to exist limited understanding of the capabilities of GIS technology in public libraries and therefore very little demand for it exists in public librarians and patrons alike.},

Specifically, how can marginalized people who do not have the resources to produce, self-categorize, analyze, or store ``big data'' claim their place in the big data debates? I examine the place of lesbians and queer women in the big data debates through the Lesbian Herstory Archive's not ``big'' enough lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, and queer (LGBTQ) organizing history data set---perhaps the largest data set known to exist on LGBTQ activist history---as one such alternative. In a contribution to critical data studies, I take a queer feminist approach to the scale of big data by reading for the imbricated scales and situated knowledge of data.},

The National Library of New Zealand has a statutory role in supporting and advancing the work of Aotearoa New Zealand libraries to ensure documentary heritage and taonga is collected and preserved across the country's memory system. This role includes supporting the collecting and curation of born-digital content. Aotearoa New Zealand's Gallery Library Archive Museum (GLAM) sector is small but varied and diverse, so requires a flexible and adaptive plan to grow experience and capability in this area. This paper will describe the background research undertaken to gain a better understanding of the current environment, describe the development and delivery of pilot training in managing born-digital archival content, and outline our next steps. Driving this effort has been two foundational principles: 1) theory and practice are always in conversation with each other and practical hands-on experience is as important as theoretical knowledge and understanding; and 2) the work of growing capability should be done in a spirt of collaboration and partnership, meeting each other as equals and learning from each other.},

  abstract = {Maps get used for decision making about the world's most pressing problems (e.g., climate change, refugee crises, biodiversity loss, rising inequality, pandemic disease). Although maps have historically been a trusted source of information, changes in society (e.g., lower levels of trust in decision makers) and in mapmaking technologies and practices (e.g., anyone can now make their own maps) mean that we need to spend some time thinking about how, when, and why people trust maps and mapmaking processes. This is critically important if we want stakeholders to engage constructively with the information we present in maps, because they are unlikely to do so if they do not trust what they see. Here I outline three questions about trust and maps that I think need research attention. First, how can we focus map readers' attention on the trustworthiness of mapped data, especially if trustworthiness changes as in the case of real-time data sources? Second, does presenting uncertainty information on maps affect the level of trust map readers have in the map, and if so, does trust vary depending on how the uncertainty information is presented? Finally, how does virality affect trust? Are viral maps less trusted? The time and resources required to develop a better understanding of how trust in maps might be changing will be repaid. The world needs good information to guide policy- and decision-making. Well designed maps can help stakeholders to work together to solve problems, but only if they are trusted.},

  abstract = {The Wayback Machine, the world's most extensive web archive, contains over 370 billion webpages dating to 1996. Yet despite its tagline, ``Universal Access to All Knowledge,'' overwhelmed visitors report frustration and trouble with keyword searching and site navigation. This essay uses the Wayback Machine to demonstrate how access as a digital archival ideal is realized only to the extent that it is defined in terms of delivery and not disposition. Further, I submit that the combination of copious delivery and a weak structure, or lack of meaningful arrangement, is conducive to fl{\^a}nerie, a perusal movement through digital objects. Contra the cultural imaginary of the fl{\^a}neur as a figure of pleasure, I suggest that practices of fl{\^a}nerie generate an experience of displacement and angst. With reference to Martin Heidegger's concept of the unheimlich (uncanny), I characterize being in a web archive as immersive but anxiously placeless. I then rely on Heidegger again to identify a productively dispositional role for rhetoric in digital archiving. As logos, rhetoric builds a structure, or ``dwelling,'' that might provide orientation and make the archival unheimlich tolerable. The essay's implications pertain to the conditions of inhabitability in networked culture, which by design is functionally archival.},

It draws on vibrant materialism and web archiving, framing born digital objects as assemblages and proposing a distinction between these and reborn digital objects, i.e. their collected counterparts. The paper relates this new framing of digital objects to established museological frameworks, such as analyses of the musealization process through the lenses of semiotics and research on authenticity in relation to digital reproductions, in order to unpick the ontological and epistemological transformation this contemporary form of heritage undergoes in entering the museum.},

  abstract = {Access to data is seen as a key priority today. Yet, the vast majority of digital cultural data preserved in archives is inaccessible due to privacy, copyright or technical issues. Emails and other born-digital collections are often uncatalogued, unfindable and unusable. In the case of documents that originated in paper format before being digitised, copyright can be a major obstacle to access. To solve the problem of access to digital archives, cross-disciplinary collaborations are absolutely essential. The big challenges of our time---from global warming to social inequalities---cannot be solved within a single discipline. The same applies to the challenge of ``dark'' archives closed to users. We cannot expect archivists or digital humanists to find a magical solution that will instantly make digital records more accessible. Instead, we need to set up collaborations across disciplines that seldom talk to each other. Based on 21 interviews with 26 archivists, librarians and other professionals in cultural institutions, we identify key obstacles to making digitised and born-digital collections more accessible to users. We outline current levels of access to a wide range of collections in various cultural organisations, including no access at all and limited access (for example, when users are required to travel on-site to consult documents). We suggest possible solutions to the problems of access---including the ethical use of Artificial Intelligence to unlock ``dark'' archives inaccessible to users. Finally, we propose the creation of a global user community who would participate in decisions on access to digital collections.},

  abstract = {An appreciation for old maps as culturally important documents came slowly in the United States. The first precondition for this shift was the reframing of history brought by political independence. The second was the growth of facsimile maps, which made these sources available to a wider audience. The third was a loose network of scholars, archivists, collectors, and federal actors---including Johann Georg Kohl---who gradually began to advocate for the cultural and political significance of old maps. Yet ongoing advocacy for a federal map collection did not produce results until the end of the Civil War, just as the trade in old maps coincided with the emergence of university-based historical and geographical research. The rapid growth of institutional map collections---including the Library of Congress Division of Maps---by the turn of the twentieth century bears out this shift. The idea that outdated maps might be valuable evidence of history and culture could only develop once maps were understood not simply as instruments of accuracy, but meaningful artifacts of history. Here we trace this complex story across multiple areas of American life from the early nineteenth century to the interwar period.},

Our review and inquiry activities show that current portals suffer from two potential setbacks: inappropriate navigation tools and a lack of supports for users' understanding. This article defines a new approach to portal development using the atlas as metaphor. This allows the atlas to be used not only to access assorted thematic maps but also to discover data sets. Within the atlas, an information structure plays an important role in organizing the content. Metadata published by providers are incorporated into this structure as metadata summaries. Based upon the topical relevancy of the data, each metadata summary is linked to a specific map within a particular topic. These summaries can be represented as symbols to support discovery tasks, either loosely or strictly defined. Browsing can be used to deal with the first via navigations and map interfaces. Searching can be used to deal with the second via explorer and search presentation interfaces. A working prototype to enable users to browse and search is built as a Flash-based ArcIMS client. Whether browsing or searching, users are offered interfaces to effectively assess data suitability.},

Additionally, the resources are not always well described with web semantic metadata that facilitates discovery. In response to this challenge, The Big Ten Academic Alliance Geospatial Data Project began in 2015 to provide discoverability, facilitate access, and connect scholars to geospatial resources. Our project leverages a multi-institutional collaboration and open source technologies to improve discovery for users of geospatial data and scanned maps.

These are evaluated in the second section in relation to the driving forces behind them and their main features in terms of status, scope, access, approach to implementation and resources. The last section considers what lessons might be learnt from this experience and discusses the changing context within which the next generation of national spatial data infrastructures are likely to be formulated. It concludes with some thoughts on which countries are most likely to be candidates for the next generation of national spatial data infrastructures.},

Especially geographic information is of increasing importance for the successful execution of (public) tasks. Spatial data infrastructures (SDIs) facilitate the collection, maintenance, dissemination, and use of spatial information. Due to the continuous change of the components of the SDI, the organisational component needs to change accordingly to enable the further development of an SDI. The authors used organisational theory to develop a means to assess the success of a National SDI's organisational context. This paper works out indicators and key conditions enabling the further development of an NSDI, accounting for its stepwise development. Crucial aspects from an organisational perspective in NSDI development are the existence of a vision, leadership, communication strategy, coherence and intention of the geographic community to initiate new innovations. The extent to which these aspects are present in an SDI initiative determines its stage of development, and as a result the success of that SDI. The NSDI characteristics of The Netherlands and the United States are used to test the proposed framework.},

Currently, there are about one hundred spatial data infrastructures at the national level and many other at supra- and sub-national levels. These contemporary spatial data infrastructures operate with two main assumptions: formal organizations are the producers and suppliers of geospatial information; users are the passive recipients of information. The recent phenomenon of volunteered geographic information departs from these assumptions. In this paper, we argue that reconceptualizing the user of a spatial data infrastructure can accommodate this new phenomenon. Such a reconceptualization creates a middle ground between spatial data infrastructure and volunteered geographic information, which has important implications for future research.}

We argue that (a) modern organizations follow an institutional data imperative to collect as much data as possible; (b) as a result of the analysis and use of this data, individuals accrue a form of capital flowing from their positions as measured by various digital scoring and ranking methods; and (c) the facticity of these scoring methods makes them organizational devices with potentially stratifying effects. They offer firms new opportunities to structure and price offerings to consumers. For individuals, they create classification situations that identify shared life-chances in product and service markets. We discuss the implications of these processes and argue that they tend toward a new economy of moral judgment, where outcomes are experienced as morally deserved positions based on prior good actions and good tastes, as measured and classified by this new infrastructure of data collection and analysis.},

This article proposes a reading of the scholarly literature concerned with the social implications of this transformation. First, we discuss the rise of a new occupational class, which we call the coding elite. This group has consolidated power through their technical control over the digital means of production and by extracting labor from a newly marginalized or unpaid workforce, the cybertariat. Second, we show that the implementation of techniques of mathematical optimization across domains as varied as education, medicine, credit and finance, and criminal justice has intensified the dominance of actuarial logics of decisionmaking, potentially transforming pathways to social reproduction and mobility but also generating a pushback by those so governed. Third, we explore how the same pervasive algorithmic intermediation in digital communication is transforming the way people interact, associate, and think. We conclude by cautioning against the wildest promises of artificial intelligence but acknowledging the increasingly tight coupling between algorithmic processes, social structures, and subjectivities.},

The open data phenomenon has been examined through communication, political, and legal lenses, but the geographic perspective, which is reflected in the amount of spatial content in the catalogs, has yet to be quantified and monitored. Analyzing the availability and accessibility of geographic information in municipal open data catalogs in Canada is an important prerequisite to understanding the potential for open data to inform decision making in the public and private sectors. Building on a previous survey completed in 2012, this paper investigates the status and trends of geographic information in Canadian open data catalogs by collecting an inventory of datasets and quantifying its growth. Municipal open data catalogs across Canada were indexed according to the type of their geospatial content. The growth of open data, and more specifically geospatial content, offers the public an opportunity to know, access, and engage with government infrastructure and services.},

Using data from a crowdsourced city-plan update by the City of Palo Alto, California, this article examines the impact of a crowd's input on policy changes. We used an enacted policy change to quantify government's response to crowd suggestions, whether crowd suggestions are adopted in the policy changes or not. While the city responded to less than half of the crowd's suggestions, the likelihood of its doing so increased by 51.42 percentage points when the crowd's ideas were amplified by a citizen advisory committee (CAC), a panel of residents working with the city in the policy update. We also found that the government is more likely to respond to crowd suggestions that are perceived as actionable. These two factors---CAC and the perceived data quality---constitute a filter which the crowd's suggestions have to pass to make into the policy. This filter created a hierarchy in the participatory practice. Although crowdsourcing intends to create equality and inclusiveness in policymaking, our findings reveal that the civic data overload and the filter hierarchy complicate the adoption of crowdsourcing as a democratic innovation in governance.},

Big data also, however, poses a number of challenges and risks to geographic scholarship and raises a number of taxing epistemological, methodological and ethical questions.

I empirically assess this notion of ``surveillant anxiety'' in the context of spatial big data. Drawing on the results of a small-scale survey of understandings of location data collection and dissemination via mobile devices and their contextualization against other available data, I demonstrate that individuals are seemingly more concerned with transparency in data collection and in controlling flows of personal spatial information about themselves than they are with practices of data capture or their eventual use(s). Rather than a generalizable societal condition of ``surveillant anxiety,'' I argue that the realities of living in a (spatial) big data present are better characterized in terms of what I designate as ``anxieties of control'': the desire to discern (be aware of) and direct (determine the disclosure of) personal spatial big data flows about oneself while feeling that any attempt at exerting such control is effectively futile.},

While some uncritically accept and embrace the idea that big data will fundamentally alter every sector of society including economics, politics, health care, and knowledge production, others are more critical of the data turn. Data can be contradictory in that it can be used for surveillance, impinge on privacy, be used for secondary purposes (often without consent), and can be totalizing in that we continually create data exhaust, it can be hacked, searched, aggregated, and preserved for years. Conversely, data can be used for the public good, to promote progressive social change, and to empower people. The overarching argument presented in this paper is that critical library and information studies must include critical data studies. To develop this argument, this paper explores the ontological nature of data and their contradictory implications and effects in terms of broader society, the academy, and in LIS research, education, and practice. Next, the philosophical foundations and the work being done in the budding area of critical data studies are presented (most notably work by Rob Kitchin). Finally, the intersections between critical data studies and LIS are discussed in terms of research methodologies, philosophical underpinnings, and application of critical social theory, values, and ethics using Dalton and Thatcher's seven data criticisms.},

But it also presents practical, theoretical, and ethical considerations for qualitative researchers in particular. Discussion about open data in qualitative social psychology predates the replication crisis. However, the nuances of this ongoing discussion have not been translated into current journal guidelines on open data. In this article, we summarize ongoing debates about open data from qualitative perspectives, and through a content analysis of 261 journals we establish the state of current journal policies for open data in the domain of social psychology. We critically discuss how current common expectations for open data may not be adequate for establishing qualitative rigour, can introduce ethical challenges, and may place those who wish to use qualitative approaches at a disadvantage in peer review and publication processes. We advise that future open data guidelines should aim to reflect the nuance of arguments surrounding data sharing in qualitative research, and move away from a universal ``one-size-fits-all'' approach to data sharing. This article outlines the past, present, and the potential future of open data guidelines in social-psychological journals. We conclude by offering recommendations for how journals might more inclusively consider the use of open data in qualitative methods, whilst recognizing and allowing space for the diverse perspectives, needs, and contexts of all forms of social-psychological research.},

The case studies invite us to reconsider experimentation within the context of sensitive dialogic processes with creators and users who are unfamiliar with the conventions of museum collecting. Hence, the boundaries of experimentations are developed in relation to existing policies, organisational structures and practices, and defined by the stakes of multiple actors. To conclude, the authors argue that collecting institutions should prioritise building capacity and understanding needs and requirements for this emergent type of object, and embrace uncertainty over the imperative of long-term preservation in its fullest sense.},

Critical data studies endeavours to answer such questions.  This paper sets out a vision for critical data studies, building on the initial provocations of Dalton and Thatcher (2014).  It is divided into three sections.  The first details the recent step change in the production and employment of data and how data and databases are being reconceptualised.  The second forwards the notion of a data assemblage that encompasses all of the technological, political, social and economic apparatuses and elements that constitutes and frames the generation, circulation and deployment of data.  Drawing on the ideas of Michel Foucault and Ian Hacking it is posited that one way to enact critical data studies is to chart and unpack data assemblages.  The third starts to unpack some the ways that data assemblages do work in the world with respect to dataveillance and the erosion of privacy, profiling and social sorting, anticipatory governance, and secondary uses and control creep.  The paper concludes by arguing for greater conceptual work and empirical research to underpin and flesh out critical data studies.},

Further complicating the issue is the multiplicity of data structures that can make up the collection of geospatial information necessary for the instantiation of a map view. While there are currently no permanent solutions to these issues, there are a number of prudent steps that can be taken to preserve such data past the short-term, thus making it more likely that these valuable cultural resources can be migrated in step with advancing technologies well into the future.},

The technology is rapidly evolving and many have questions around what software to use and what staffing might be required. The American Library Association (ALA) Map and Geospatial Information Round Table (MAGIRT) Geographic Technologies Committee established the Spatial Data Subcommittee in September 2010 to investigate spatial data catalogs and provide recommendations to MAGIRT on technology, staffing needs, and similar issues needed to develop a spatial data catalog. The subcommittee conducted interviews with eleven geospatial data catalog managers at academic libraries that yielded findings showing the diversity of implementation and prioritization. Guidance is provided that will help academic libraries determine what the best approach is for their situation and needs on their campus.},

There are two ways Big Data are making a big impact: a reconceptualization of (geo)privacy, and ``algorithmic security.'' Geoprivacy is revealed as a geopolitical assemblage rather than something possessed and is part of emerging political economy of technology and neoliberal markets. Security has become increasingly algorithmic and biometric, enrolling Big Data to disambiguate the biopolitical subject. Geoweb and remote sensing technologies, companies, and knowledges are imbricated in this assemblage of algorithmic security. I conclude with three spaces of intervention; new critical histories of the geoweb that trace the relationship of geography and the state; a fuller political economy of the geoweb and its circulations of geographical knowledge; and legislative and encryption efforts that enable the geographic community to participate in public debate.},

The federal government's role has changed from being a primary provider of authoritative geospatial information to coordinating and managing geospatial data and facilitating partnerships. Congress explored issues of cost, duplication of effort, and coordination of geospatial information in hearings during the 108th Congress. However, challenges to coordinating how geospatial data are acquired and used---collecting duplicative data sets, for example---at the local, state, and federal levels, in collaboration with the private sector, are not yet resolved. Two bills introduced in the 112th Congress, H.R. 1620 and H.R. 4322, would address aspects of duplication and coordination of geospatial information.},

Archives, along with other communicational resources such as oral and ritual tradition, help to transfer information---and thereby sustain memory---from generation to generation. Two examples illustrate the interrelationship of archives and memory within this broadened view of communication and culture. The first arises from attempts to find ways to warn future generations of the location of radioactive waste repositories. The second revolves around pressure to efface from cultural landscapes evidence of tragic events that people wish to forget.},

In the near future the new types of artifacts and materials produced by the cartographers of this period will form the basis for the study of the history of modern cartography. Computer software, new computational devices, computer hardware, and complex mathematical algorithms all need to be preserved in a way that allows researchers access to the concepts and techniques that make up the cartography of today and the future. The following paper is a case study in the preservation of collections that are typically not part of the traditional materials found in map libraries. Although this paper is pragmatic in nature and focuses in particular on the software and algorithms found in the John Snyder Collection of satellite mapping materials now in the Library of Congress, it also addresses the many conceptual and theoretical problems that arise in the preservation of what the author calls ``foundational collections'' in the history of cartography.},

This classification occupies a standard IBM data card of 80 columns and will produce a sorted list for any of 13 fields. Each map requires only one card where 13 cards would be required to carry the same information on a standard card catalogue. Mechanical searching of these cards produces printed, sorted listings of any map under any of the 13 characteristics. This should greatly facilitate the rapid retrieval of maps for use in research and provide printed lists of holdings that could be made available to other libraries. It is hoped that this proposal will stimulate general interest in the problems of map classification and retrieval and any suggestions for the refinement of the system would be welcomed by the authors.},

  abstract = {Despite the prevalence of transparency discourses in economic life (e.g., postcrisis socioeconomic reforms), scholarship is just beginning to analyze how these discourses produce new relations between market actors in platform economies. In this article, we argue that in the context of financial markets and the political economy of data, transparency functions as a discursive construction that creates suitable conditions for the manufacture and extraction of data as an asset. First, we examine the role of transparency and opacity in various understandings of the 2007--2008 global financial crisis (GFC). In doing so we link the emergence of FinTech firms to a careful ex post facto reconstruction of the GFC as what we term a ``crisis of data.'' Then, through problematizing the idea that transparent economic relations necessarily lead to greater accountability, equity, or public good, we argue that transparency is better understood as a relational practice that is continuously and contingently renegotiated. Taking up the example of debt data, we provide case studies of the data brokerage companies BlackRock and dv01 to analyze how transparency constitutes the material infrastructure of debt markets, which facilitates the construction of data assets for profitable circulation in a financialized political economy. We analyze our case studies with a focus on four transparency practices used to infuse data with value---building relationality, increasing granularity, managing directionality, and creating legibility.},

Whereas the vast majority of research on financial assets focuses on the income-generating aspects of property, this article considers a more holistic approach to assets. Through detailed empirical analysis of syndication in historic tax credit and conservation easement markets, we demonstrate how assets are not just sources of income or cash flow but also---critically---sources of expense reduction. Drawing from relevant U.S. tax law and related legal provisions, we trace three interlocking components in the assetization process: enabling and disabling legislation, the structures and typologies of property ownership, and the actors that make deals happen. By starting with asset creation, rather than assumed geographies of investment, we bridge the rural--urban divide to reveal new geographies of finance sourced directly from the state. Although the tax sheltering dimensions of assets are unique in this regard, the state retains the capacity to unmake assets that lack ``economic substance.'' As such, this article offers a new direction forward---a legal-institutionalist framework---that foregrounds the state as setting and enforcing the limits to financialization.},

  abstract = {An asset is both a resource and property, in that it generates income streams with its sale price based on the capitalization of those revenues. Although an asset's income streams can be financially sliced up, aggregated, and speculated upon across highly diverse geographies, there still has to be something underpinning these financial operations. Something has to generate the income that a political economic actor can lay claim to through a property or other right, entailing a process of enclosure, rent extraction, property formation, and capitalization. Geographers and other social scientists are producing a growing literature illustrating the range of new (and old) asset classes created by capitalists in their search for revenue streams, for which we argue assetization is a necessary concept to focus on the moment of enclosure and rent extraction. It is a pressing task for human geographers to unpack the diverse and contingent `asset geographies' entailed in this assetization process. As a middle range concept and empirical problematic, we argue that assetization is an important focal point for wider debates in human geography by focusing attention on the moment of enclosure, rent extraction, and material remaking of society which the making of a financial asset implies.},

  abstract = {This paper describes selected aspects of the Domesday project led by the BBC and intended to create 'an exhibition of Britain' in the 1980s. Among other things, this resulted in what is perhaps the first example of a second-generation Geographical Information System (GIS). Based upon a micro-computer linked to a new Laser Vision-Read Only Memory (LV-ROM), this holds 54 000 images (maps, photos, satellite images, etc.), 300 megabytes of digital data and millions of words of text per side of video disk; the different types of data are cross-referenced by geographical position or by theme. Access to the data is by pointing at maps, by specification of place name or geographical coordinates, or through use of a thesaurus: the source and storage form of the data is transparent to the user. Included in the initial disks are 21 000 files of spatial data showing national coverage down, in some cases, to 1 square kilometre resolution. Data sets stored include geology, soils, geochemistry, population, employment and unemployment, agricultural production and land use/land cover. Though the normal purchase price of the data held would be over {\pounds}250 000, the price charged to schools for the complete system-hardware, software and data-at the launch date in November 1986 was {\pounds}3000. All this has significant implications for the spread of use of geographical data bases and GIS technology; it also has major implications for the teaching of Geography at different levels.},

  abstract = {Digital archives are the preferred means for open access to research data. They play essential roles in knowledge infrastructures---robust networks of people, artifacts, and institutions---but little is known about how they mediate information exchange between stakeholders. We open the ``black box'' of data archives by studying DANS, the Data Archiving and Networked Services institute of The Netherlands, which manages 50+ years of data from the social sciences, humanities, and other domains. Our interviews, weblogs, ethnography, and document analyses reveal that a few large contributors provide a steady flow of content, but most are academic researchers who submit data sets infrequently and often restrict access to their files. Consumers are a diverse group that overlaps minimally with contributors. Archivists devote about half their time to aiding contributors with curation processes and half to assisting consumers. Given the diversity and infrequency of usage, human assistance in curation and search remains essential. DANS' knowledge infrastructure encompasses public and private stakeholders who contribute, consume, harvest, and serve their data---many of whom did not exist at the time the DANS collections originated---reinforcing the need for continuous investment in digital data archives as their communities, technologies, and services evolve.},

The series, funded by the IMLS, is intended to be integrated into LIS coursework and used for professional development training in libraries. The modules encourage information professionals to work alongside community members as they use civic data to uncover structures of oppression, tell their own stories, and address information needs. Through the series and its integration in LIS courses and library training, we aim to prepare library workers to be data intermediaries who contribute to equitable civic data creation, stewardship, and sharing.},
